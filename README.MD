# MY Scrapyard with lift props and Scrapyard Without list props
- This is my first ymap that i made.
- I know that the spray booth loses his colors in the evening/night but I don't know how to solve this.
- If you know how i can fix that, please let my know.
- I created this ymap for my mh-carlift that is also available [here](https://github.com/MaDHouSe79/mh-carlift)
